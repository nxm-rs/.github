# nxm-rs

Rust tools that actually work. No buzzwords, just code that ships.

## What we build

**[nexum](https://github.com/nxm-rs/nexum)** - Terminal-first Ethereum wallet for people who read docs
**[vertex](https://github.com/nxm-rs/vertex)** - Swarm node that actually works

## Quick links

- [Contributing](https://github.com/nxm-rs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) - How to help without wasting time
- [Blog](https://nxm.rs) - Occasional thoughts when we're not coding

## Philosophy

- Ship working code over perfect architecture
- Fix bugs that matter, ignore the ones that don't
- Document what confuses, skip what's obvious
- If a process doesn't help ship, kill it

## Status

Most things are broken. We're fixing them. PRs welcome if they actually improve things.
