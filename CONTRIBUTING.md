# Contributing to nxm-rs

Thanks for considering contributing. Here's how to do it without wasting time.

## Before you start

1. **Check existing issues/PRs** - Someone might already be working on it
2. **Open an issue first** - Unless it's a typo fix. Let's agree on the problem before you code the solution
3. **One PR, one thing** - Don't bundle unrelated changes

## Code standards

- **It should work** - Test your code. "It compiles" isn't enough
- **It should be readable** - Code is read more than written
- **It should be documented** - At least explain the why, if not the what
- **It should follow conventions** - Match the existing code style

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork and create your branch from `main`
2. Write code that actually solves the problem
3. Add tests if you're adding features
4. Update docs if you're changing behavior
5. Make sure all tests pass
6. Submit PR with a clear description

## What we're looking for

✅ **We want:**
- Bug fixes for actual bugs
- Performance improvements with benchmarks
- Features that solve real problems
- Documentation that helps developers
- Tests that catch real issues

❌ **We don't want:**
- Cosmetic changes with no real benefit
- "Refactoring" that doesn't improve anything measurable
- Features nobody asked for
- Breaking changes without strong justification
- PRs that don't pass CI

## Code Review

Expect honest feedback. We care about:
- Does it work?
- Is it maintainable?
- Does it make the codebase better?

We don't care about:
- Perfect variable names
- Tabs vs spaces (use the formatter)
- Your feelings

## Getting Help

- Open an issue with your question
- Check the existing documentation
- Read the code - it's often clearer than docs

## License

By contributing, you agree your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.

**TL;DR**: Make it work, make it clear, make it tested. PRs welcome if they actually improve things.
