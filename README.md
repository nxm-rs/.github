# .github

Default community health files for the nxm-rs organisation. Because even chaos needs structure.

## What Is Here

- **Issue Templates**: Bug reports and feature requests that get to the point
- **PR Template**: What changed and why it will not break everything (hopefully)
- **Contributing Guidelines**: How to contribute without wasting everyone's time

## Using These Templates

These templates automatically apply to all repositories in the nxm-rs organisation that do not have their own `.github` folder.

## Customising for Your Repo

If you need different templates for your specific repository:
1. Create your own `.github/` folder in your repo
2. Add your custom templates
3. They will override these defaults

## Labels

We use a pragmatic labelling system across all repos:

### Priority
- `p0-fire`: Production is burning
- `p1-broken`: Actually broken, fix this week
- `p2-annoying`: Not broken but annoying
- `p3-maybe`: Nice to have, probably never happens

### Status
- `blocked`: Cannot proceed
- `investigating`: Someone is looking at it
- `pr-welcome`: We want this but will not do it

### Type
- `bug`: Code does the wrong thing
- `feature`: New capability
- `dx`: Developer experience issues
- `perf`: Performance problems
- `debt`: Technical debt
- `docs`: Documentation issues

### Effort
- `effort/minutes`: Quick fix
- `effort/hours`: Few hours work
- `effort/days`: Few days work
- `effort/weeks`: Week+ of work

## Philosophy

We write code that works. We fix bugs that matter. We build features that solve real problems.

No corporate theatre. No process for process's sake. Just pragmatic engineering.
